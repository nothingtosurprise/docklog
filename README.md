# 🚀 Why DockLog?

Most Docker log viewers are built for a single administrator.

DockLog is built for the entire team.

- **Team-First Security**  
  Give developers access only to the containers they need using wildcard and regex-based RBAC.

- **Audit Everything**  
  Track exactly who restarted, stopped, or modified containers with full audit logging.

- **Zero-Config Deployment**  
  No external database. No large configuration files. Just run the container and start monitoring.

- **Performance Without Compromise**  
  Written in Go for extremely low memory and CPU usage.

- **Modern Developer Experience**  
  Fast, responsive UI designed for operational workflows.

## Generate Secure Secret Key

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

---

# 👥 User Roles

## 👑 Administrator

- Full container visibility
- User management
- Audit log access
- Full container control

---

## 🛠 Staff Member

Container visibility is controlled using patterns such as:

```text
redis
backend-*
prod-*, *-app
^prod-.*$
```

Users only see containers matching their assigned rules.

# 🐳 Docker Compose

### Option A: Normal Auth Mode (Default)
```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  docklog:
    image: aimldev/docklog:latest
    container_name: docklog
    ports:
      - "8888:8000"
    environment:
      - SECRET_KEY=your-secure-key-here
      - DB_PATH=/app/data/docklog.db
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Option B: No-Auth Mode
Bypasses the login screen and user database entirely, giving you immediate dashboard access:
```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  docklog:
    image: aimldev/docklog:latest
    container_name: docklog
    ports:
      - "8888:8000"
    environment:
      - DISABLE_AUTH=true
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start DockLog:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8888
```

---

# 🐳 Direct Docker Run

### Option A: Normal Auth Mode (Default)
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name docklog \
  -p 8888:8000 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your-secure-key-here \
  -e DB_PATH=/app/data/docklog.db \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  aimldev/docklog:latest
```

### Option B: No-Auth Mode
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name docklog \
  -p 8888:8000 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e DISABLE_AUTH=true \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  aimldev/docklog:latest
```

# 🔒 Docker Socket Security

DockLog requires access to:

```text
/var/run/docker.sock
```

This effectively grants Docker API access to the application.

Recommended production setup:

- place behind Nginx or Traefik
- enable HTTPS
- restrict public access
- expose only trusted networks
- use strong administrator credentials
- rotate `SECRET_KEY` periodically
